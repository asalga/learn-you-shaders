            Most of the work will be done in a fragment shader, but we'll need an environment to give us a WebGL context. We'll use p5.js for the foundation.

        <p>
            Let's break down what we're seeing. If you notice that the syntax looks strangely similar to C, you're right! GLSL is based on the C language because it was/is popular. Lots of developers were familiar with it, so the comittee decided to use it. There's some other 'non-C' looking stuff. The vec4 is part of the language that defines a 4-dimentional vector. And the constructor syntax is quite handy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>gl_FragColor</em> is a built-in. You need to assign a value to this variable for the shader to make sense. After all, that's what a shader does. Computer some stuff and assign a color to a fragment/pixel.
        </p>
        <h3>Normalized Colours</h3>
        <p>The colours used in a shader range from 0 to 1. Maybe you're used to 0-255? Have you ever used colorModeRGB(1) in Processing? Similar idea.</p>
        <hr/>
        <h2>Hello, Where is (0,0) !?</h2>
        <p>
            When I first start messing around with a graphics context, I need to know where 0,0 is. Sometimes its top left, sometimes bottom left...I could tell you where it is for shaders--but let's write some code to prove it ourselves!
        </p>

        <p>
        	What we'll do is tell the shader: Hey, can you draw a red box when the x pixel and y pixel are less then 10? From that we can infer where 0,0 is.
        </p>
        <textarea class='glsl-code'>
// 0.1  Hello, Where is [0,0] !?

void main() {
  gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);

  if(gl_FragCoord.x < 10.0 && gl_FragCoord.y < 10.0){
    gl_FragColor += vec4(1.0);
  }
}</textarea>

<p>
	So it turns out that the 0,0 is at the bottom left. Maybe one day you'll take a break from shaders and come back a few months later. instead of doing a search, you can now just write this little snippet to prove it for yourself and jog your memory.
