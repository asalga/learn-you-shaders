            One of the first times I came across this tunnel effect demo was on ShaderToy. I was immediately captivated by terse code. In about 5 lines of code, a beautiful and convincing visualization emerges--it seemed magical.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was motivated to understand exactly how it worked. I studied the code--dismantling and putting it back together. It took me quite a while, but I'd like to share what I have learned. Hopefully this tutorial will be of use to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're going to build up the shader piecemeal. Each time a new concept is introduced, the code in the shader will be highlighted. This tutorial expects that you're familiar with some shader built-in types, uniforms, textures, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Step X: Empty Canvas</h2>
        <p>
            Let's start by filling the canvas with a solid color. Oh boy, much excitement.
        </p>

        <h2>Step X: Texture</h2>
        <p>
            Let's map a texture onto the canvas.
        </p>
        <!-- <textarea class='glsl-code' data-params='{"width":400,"height":200,"tex0":"tex/debug.png","lines":[4,5,6]}' data-example='code/texture.glsl'></textarea> -->

        <p>
            We need 2 uniforms: a texture unit and a resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>texture2D</em> function expects a texture and a vec2 with normalized components. For the coordinates, we'll take the current pixel location and divide by the resolution.
            <code>
                [x] 0..400 => 0..1<br />
                [y] 0..200 => 0..1
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <!--
            We need the resolution because we need to create a vector with normalized components.

            Each fragment will be the result of sampling the texture.
            the bottom left corner is 0,0. The top-right corner will be 1,1.
        -->
        </p>
        <p>
            Looks like our texture is getting stretched. Well, what do you expect? The canvas is a rectangle and the texture is a square. We're doing a 1:1 mapping, so yeah, it'll get stretched. You'll also notice the texture is also upside down! What the shit? Well, that just won't do...
        </p>
        <p>
            Note how we're using GLSL's syntactic sugar to perform component-wise division. If you are feeling verbose, you can write the division thus:
            <br />
            <textarea class='glsl-snippet'>vec2 uv = vec2(gl_FragCoord.x / u_res.x, gl_FragCoord.y / u_res.y);</textarea>
        </p>

        <div class='advanced'>
            <img src="../public/icons/advanced.png" class="icon" />
            <span>Texture repeating</span>
            <br />
            <p>
                Wait a second! Doesn't texture2D do texture repeating? Can't we pass in non-normalized values? Yes. OpenGL and WebGL have a function we can call to set the texture repetition parameter (repeat,stretch,etc.). Try multiplying the uv.x component by something greater than 1. What happens?
            </p>
            <p>
                We're going to pretend that texture2D expects normalized values, so we'll just take care of 'wrapping' the values ourselves.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Step X: Texture Flip</h2>
        <p>
            WebGL has this weird behaviour where textures are flipped. We can actually solve this by getting the rendered from p5 and calling a function that tells WebGL if we want textures fippped.
        </p>
        <p>
            But since we have power of shaders, we can do the flip within the shader itself. Since we know that the maximum value of y is 1, we start with 1 and subtract whatever the y value is. This remaps the y-coordinates from 0..1 to 1..0.
        </p>

        <h2>Step X: Repeating the Texture</h2>
        <p>
            Examine the final demo and you can see that the texture is repeated. We can easily achieve this by using the built-in mod function. Not surprisingly, mod accepts 2 values.
        </p>
        <p>
            We scale the x component by 4 and apply mod. This ensures the final value will range from 0 to 1. The value 4 was arbitrary just to demonstrate that indeed the texture does repeat. Experiment with some values here as well as the second argument for mod. What does 2.0 do? 0.5?
        </p>
        <textarea class='glsl-code' data-params='{"width":400,"height":200,"tex0":"tex/debug.png","lines":[12]}' data-example='code/repeat_tex.glsl'></textarea>




        <!-- ************* -->
        <hr/>
        <h2>Step X: Perspective</h2>
        <p>
            Hold onto your butts. This is where shit gets real. We're going to dive head-first into the magic of the demo. The core 'magic' of the tunnel is the perspective that gets created. How is this done?
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to somehow repeat the texture more frequently the closer it is to the center of the canvas. Since we don't have a circular texture yet, we're going to make the texture repeat 'faster' as it appears closer to the left edge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alright, so there's the magic: Go to Google and plug in this formula: <a href="http://google.ca/search?q=y+%3D+1%2Fx"><code>y = 1/x</code></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is a graphical representation as well as a table to help better understand the relationship between x and y.

        </table>
        <p>
            This graph show that y has a sharp decline and tends towards infinity as x increases in size.Â  However our x ranges from 0 to 1, not 0 to 26 as the table suggests.
